BeSuccessful app - progress tracking app made in Express.js

BeSuccessful is an online web application for tracking one person’s progress overtime. The users can see all the statistics to compete, motivate each other and evolve together. 
There are three sections: regular habits, daily to-dos and journal pages. Each one of them are user-friendly and really simple to use, every ‘move’ being tracked down. The app also contains motivational messages and tips to make the user act productive.
The user’s top contains extracted data from the database and calculates statistics by different criterions to see who are the most active ones.

The project’s back-end was built using Express.js & postgresql. The template engine for this app is pug and it was created with bootstrap. Each feature was designed to be easy-to-use, so on the press of a button, the user can create and mark down every time he has done a task or habit he was willing to finish (but also reset all of his progress or delete specific ones to start over). Doing so will get him points and place him in the top list, but also in the ‘top chart’ (made in the form of a doughnut), divided depending on the statistics. 

Each user can see how many times he completed/uncompleted a habit in total, to have an idea of what direction he is heading. Also, the user can go back in time and see all the tasks he had to finish for the day, the percentage of to-dos completion and the total times he finished/didn’t finish them.
